                  Your personal privacy is very important to us. To better
                  protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy notice
                  explaining our online information practices and the choices
                  you can make about the way your information is collected and

                  This privacy policy applies to all information collected
                  through the honeyminer.com website and associated application.
                  We collect the following personal information: name, email
                  address, IP address, cryptocurrency wallet addresses, and
                  street address.
                </p>

                  Personally identifiable information collected by us will only
                  be used for the purpose of providing you with our service. We
                  collect this information so that you will be able to access
                  your account and so that we will be able to transfer mined
                  cryptocurrencies to your account. We may also send you email

                  We use commercially acceptable data collection, storage and
                  processing practices, and security measures to protect against
                  unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of
                  your personal information and data. Sensitive and private data
                  exchange between you and our site/application happens over a
                  SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and
                  protected with digital signatures. However, it is important to
                  understand that no method of transmission over the internet,
                  or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore,
                  while we use commercially acceptable means to protect your
                  personal identification information, we cannot guarantee its
                  absolute security. Regardless of our precautions, “perfect
                  security” does not exist on the internet. We cannot ensure or
